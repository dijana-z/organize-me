## :computer: Organize Me
A project in Django-Rest Framework for home management and organization. The idea is to have groups of individuals inside one household and to manage time and resources within the household and individuals (family members) themselves.

## :information_source: About:
Each family member will have a list of tasks assigned to them, see tasks of other family members and add new tasks. Apart from tasks, there will be a shopping list that every family member can see and modify, along with a complete updateable list of groceries already in the household (so every family member can see what is already available). And finally, money management will also be included, both for the household and each member individually.
